# Interactive Textile Prototype (Arduino)

This repository contains the final project from *Computing Fabrics*, a course exploring the integration of embedded systems and electronic components into textile-based interfaces.

## Project Overview

The project is an interactive object that responds to touch via conductive and heat-sensitive threads embedded in fabric. Sensor input is processed by an Arduino microcontroller, which triggers an audio output when user interaction is detected.

The goal of the project was to explore how tactile materials can function as intuitive human–computer interfaces, combining physical craft with embedded programming.

## Technical Details

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino
- **Language:** C / Arduino (.ino)
- **Inputs:** Conductive and heat-sensitive textile sensors
- **Outputs:** Audio playback triggered by sensor thresholds
- **Methods:** Signal reading, thresholding, event-based audio control

The code handles sensor calibration, continuous input polling, and conditional logic to trigger sound output based on user interaction.

## Files

– Arduino source code for sensor input handling and audio output

## Context

This project was completed as part of coursework at MIT and reflects an early exploration of embedded systems, physical computing, and interaction design through nontraditional materials.

## Notes

This repository is presented as a technical archive and learning artifact demonstrating embedded programming and physical interaction design.
